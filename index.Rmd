# What is LiDAR Sensing?

LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging or Laser Imaging, detection and ranging. It refers to the method of remote sensing which uses a light or laser to emit pulses and measuring the time it takes for the return light to reach the sensor. 

This technique has uses in both satellites and ground sensors, and has even been integrated into self-driving cars!

#History of LiDAR?

* LiDAR technology was developed shortly after the invention of the laser in 1960. 

* The Hughes Aircraft Company founder introduced the first LiDAR-like system in 1961, the system had the ability to calculate distances by measuring the time it took for a signal to return. (`r Citep(myBib, "Wikipedia2026")`)

* One of the first uses of this technology were by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research to measure pollution.

* Since then LiDAR has been important in space missions such as Apollo 15. Has been used by the European Space Agency and brands like Apple have developed LiDAR sensors for their iPhone 12 and later which can measure general 3D shapes.

#How does LiDAR Work?

.pull-right[* LiDAR technology is an example of active sensing, meaning it must emit energy. It can use ultraviolet, visible or near-infared light to send out its signal and wait for the backscatter to return. This is often called the Time of Flight (ToF).

* LiDAR scanners can generate million of points in the scans they make which are called a **'point cloud'** and can be used to generate 3D measurements of an area.

* The video shows how a satellite using LiDAR is able to collect data about tree heights and generate an extremely detailed topographic picture.]

# Applications of LiDAR

.left-column[
## Terrain Mapping

## Buildings

## Vehicles
]

.right-column[
LiDAR is extremely useful for surveying large areas of forests in order to measure vegetation density, and generate things like Digital Terrain Models or Digital Elevation models that have many uses in tracking things like flood risk, or monitoring coastal erosion.

LiDAR can also be used to gater information about building heights in urban settings, and create detailed plans of building projects for engineers.

LiDAR has also been used self-driving cars and uses laser pulses to determine the environment around the car creating a 3D map. Sensors currently used by brands like Volvo are can be bulky as they have to provide a 360 view on the top of the car but they are often superior to cameras in terms of the depth perception.

# Applications: EarthCARE’s atmospheric LiDAR

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[EarthCare LiDAR background]
* The European Space Agency's EarthCARE (Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer) mission launched on 28 May 2024.

* Launched in partnership between the ESA and JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency) this mission aims to collect information on the role of clouds and aerosols and their effects on the Earth and our climate.
]

.panel[.panel-name[LiDAR mechanisms]
* The EarthCare Satellite carries 4 key instruments which enable it to collect data -  the Atmospheric LiDAR (ATLID), the Broadband Radiometer (BBR), the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), and the Multispectral Imager (MSI) 

* The [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/EarthCARE/EarthCARE_s_atmospheric_lidar) uses the Atmospheric LiDAR that emits an ultraviolet wavelength laser beam to enable the measurement of atmospheric particles and investigate clouds.

* The ultraviolet light scatters when encounters aerosol particles and this back scattered data is collected by the received of the sensor.

]


.panel[.panel-name[Orbital information]

* Operates at a wavelenght of 355nm 

* The atmospheric LiDAR provides a vertical resolution of 103 m from the ground up to 20 km altitude and 500 m in the range 20–40 km altitude.

* Over a three-year lifetime the atmospheric lidar will have generated approximately five billion laser pulses, or just over 2 minutes of laser light.(`r Citep(myBib, "ESA2026")`)

]

.panel[.panel-name[Recent Applications]
* In September 2025 the [EarthCARE satellite](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/EarthCARE/EarthCARE_lifts_the_clouds_on_climate_models) collected images over Typhoon Ragasa near the Philippines. It was able to create a detailed picture of cloud properties such as water content.

* Using this data to improve our ability to model the atmosphere, scientists can better understand the impact of greenhouse gas aerosols on clouds.

* The 3D cloud representation created by the LiDAR scanner is also useful in monitoring how sunlight is scattered and how it may be interacting with aerosols in the atmosphere.

# Reflections


I've enjoyed reading and learning more about the many applicatiosn of LiDAR sensors, from electric vehicles, to environmental monitoring, and uses in urban space scanning. I have 3 key reflections from this LiDAR research exercise: 

* I think the amount of data produced in a 'point cloud' poses certain challenges given the millions of data points collected so it will be interesting to learn more about Google Earth Engine and how it can cope with these amounts of data. 

* It is also interesting to see how the technology has become more accessible, with some basic incorporation into iPhones, and the ability to purchase or rent LiDAR scanners for a couple hundred pounds. I think this technology has extremely wide ranging applications and I'd be interested to see how it can be combined with other satellite data, or vector data to make it even more useful.

* In relation to my current work in Local Government, I can see how uses of this technology in the planning sector through LiDAR ground sensors which are more portable would be beneficial to architects, engineers and planners for generating 3D models of sites.
